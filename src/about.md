I'm a C++ software engineer specializing in systems programming. Currently, I work at Roblox where I work the data model of our custom game engine.

## Background

I graduated with a degree in CS and Math from the University of Washington. My passion for programming started when I was making text adventure RPGs in school, and I've since retained that love for gaming. I'm also a big fan of Linux and love fiddling with my system and the satisfaction of building a system that aligns perfectly with my workflow and preferences.
