I'm a C++ software engineer specializing in systems programming. I currently work at Roblox, where I develop the data model for our custom game engine.

## Background

I graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Washington. My journey into programming began with text adventure RPGs in school, sparking a passion for both code and gaming that continues today. These days, I'm particularly fascinated by parallelism and the challenge of leveraging modern multi-core CPUs effectively. I'm also a Linux enthusiast who loves tinkering with systems and optimizing my development environment.
